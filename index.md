<h2 style="color: blue;">ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>

<h3 style="color: blue;">Context</h3>

Within the "Information Technology Skills" course at the University of Bologna, we worked on a project to enrich the ArCo knowledge graph of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage. On the homepage of our website you can find our topic, the goals we wanted to achieve with this project, the methodology we applied and who we are. In order to get more detailled information about our project click [here](another-page.md) for the full project report or directly choose the artwork you're interested in:

- [Cristo morto, Andrea Mantegna](cristomorto.md)

<div style="margin-top: 18px;"></div>

- [San Giorgio e il drago, Andrea Mantegna](sangiorgioeildrago.md)

<h3 style="color: blue;">Topic</h3> 

Andrea Mantegna, a Pioneer of Perspective: _Cristo morto (stampa)_ and _San Giorgio e il drago_ 

<h3 style="color: blue;">Goal</h3>

We want to identify and explore artworks related to Andrea Mantegna in the ArCo knowledge graph in order to enrich some of them with new RDF triples that could be added to the knowledge graph.

<h3 style="color: blue;">Methodology</h3>

- Exploring the ArCo ontologies and knowledge graph: <http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/>
- Exploring the ArCo SPARQL endpoint: <https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql>
- Collecting information about the chosen artworks with Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama and Mixtral that could be used in order to enrich the ArCo knowledge graph.
- Questioning these LLM's with different prompting techniques such as Zero-shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought and Generated Knowledge Prompting.
- Creating triples for a potential enrichment of the ArCo knowledge graph.
- Building a website with GITHUB: link
