<h2 style="color: blue;">ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>

<h3 style="color: blue;">Context</h3>

Within the "Information Technology Skills" course at the University of Bologna, we worked on a project to enrich the ArCo knowledge graph of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage. On the homepage of our website you can find our topic, the goals we wanted to achieve with this project, the methodology we applied and who we are. In order to get more detailled information about our project click [here](another-page.md) for the full project report or directly choose the artwork you're interested in:

Andrea Mantegna, a Pioneer of Perspective: Discover the _Cristo Morto_ and _San Giorgio e il drago_ 

Andrea Mantegna, a revolutionary artist who left an indelible mark on the Italian Renaissance, is renowned for his mastery of perspective and engraving. Born in Padua in 1431, Mantegna absorbed classical influences and developped a passion for sculpture. His groundbreaking use of perspective, evident in works like the "Camera degli Sposi" (picture above), created illusions of depth and realism that captivated his contemporaries. Mantegna's artistic genius extended beyond painting - he excelled in engraving, contributing to the dissemination of Renaissance ideals across Europe. This website delves into the world of Andrea Mantegna, exploring his artistic brilliance.

<h3 style="color: blue;">Goal</h3>

We want to identify and explore artworks related to Andrea Mantegna in the ArCo knowledge graph in order to enrich some of them with new RDF triples that could be added to the knowledge graph.

<h3 style="color: blue;">Methodology</h3>

- Exploring the ArCo ontologies and knowledge graph: <http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/>
- Exploring the ArCo SPARQL endpoint: <https://dati.cultura.gov.it/sparql>
- Collecting information about the chosen artworks with Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama and Mistral that could be used in order to enrich the ArCo knowledge graph.
- Questioning these LLM's with different prompting techniques such as Zero-shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought and Generated Knowledge Prompting.
- Creating triples for a potential enrichment of the ArCo knowledge graph.
- Building a website with GITHUB: <https://github.com> with HTML.
