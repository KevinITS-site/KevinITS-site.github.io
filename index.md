ArCo: the knowledge graph of the Italian Cultural Heritage

Large Language Models: Gemini and ChatGPT

<h3 style="color: blue;">Topic</h3> 

Michelangelo's artworks: an in-depth analysis of _Piet√† (stampa)_ and _David-Apollo_ 

<h3 style="color: blue;">Goal</h3>

We want to identify and explore artworks related to Andrea Mantegna in the ArCo knowledge graph in order to enrich some of them with new RDF triples that could be added to the knowledge graph.

<h3 style="color: blue;">Methodology</h3>

- Exploring the ArCo ontologies and knowledge graph: link
- Exploring the ArCo SPARQL endpoint: link
- Collecting information about the chosen artworks with Large Language Models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama and Mixtral.
- Questioning these LLM's with different prompting techniques such as Zero-shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought and Generated Knowledge Prompting.
- Building a website with GITHUB: link
